# Programming_for_Math_Science

Programming for math and science is a class I took that teaches python for scientific and linear algebra applications.
This is select code from that class.

Problem1: This is from the final. I created a class for arithmitic in a set Zp where p is a prime number. 
3DRotation: This progrma grpahs an object in 3d then roatates it and grpahs it again
HughesJasonLab4mod/scr: This was a prgrma to do arithematic with vectors. The mod file is the class, the script file
is just for testing.
Projectionlab: This takes a cube and projects it onto a 2d plane (like a camera!)
